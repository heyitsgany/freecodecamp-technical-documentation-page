          Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for
          mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 39 KB of JS, it
          has all the mapping features most developers ever need.
        </p>

        <p>
          Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in
          mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile
          platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy
          to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that
          is a joy to contribute to.
        </p>

        <p>
          This step-by-step guide will quickly get you started on Leaflet
          basics, including setting up a Leaflet map, working with markers,
          polylines and popups, and dealing with events.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before writing any code for the map, you need to do the following
          preparation steps on your page:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Include Leaflet CSS file in the head section of your document:
            <code
              >&#60;link rel="stylesheet"
              href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;integrity="sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A=="
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;crossorigin=""/&#62;</code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Include Leaflet JavaScript file after Leaflet’s CSS:
            <code
              >&#60;!-- Make sure you put this AFTER Leaflet's CSS --&#62;
              <br />
              &#60;script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js"
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;integrity="sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA=="
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;crossorigin=""&#62;&#60;/script&#62;</code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Put a div element with a certain id where you want your map to be:
            <code>&#60;div id="mapid"&#62;&#60;/div&#62;</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the map container has a defined height, for example by
            setting it in CSS:
            <code>#mapid { height: 180px; }</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you're ready to initialize the map and do some stuff with it.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="setting_up_the_map">
        <header><h1>Setting up the map</h1></header>
        <p>
          Let’s create a map of the center of London with pretty Mapbox Streets
          tiles. First we’ll initialize the map and set its view to our chosen
          geographical coordinates and a zoom level:
        </p>
        <code>var mymap = L.map('mapid').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);</code>
        <p>
          By default (as we didn’t pass any options when creating the map
          instance), all mouse and touch interactions on the map are enabled,
          and it has zoom and attribution controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we’ll add a tile layer to add to our map, in this case it’s a
          Mapbox Streets tile layer. Creating a tile layer usually involves
          setting the URL template for the tile images, the attribution text and
          the maximum zoom level of the layer. In this example we’ll use the
          mapbox/streets-v11 tiles from Mapbox’s Static Tiles API (in order to
          use tiles from Mapbox, you must also request an access token). Because
          this API returns 512x512 tiles by default (instead of 256x256), we
          will also have to explicitly specify this and offset our zoom by a
          value of -1.
        </p>
        <code
          >L.tileLayer('https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{id}/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token={accessToken}',
          { <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attribution: 'Map data &copy; &#60;a
          href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap&#60;/a&#62;
          contributors, Imagery © &#60;a
          href="https://www.mapbox.com/"&#62;Mapbox&#60;/a&#62;',
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;maxZoom: 18, <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;id: 'mapbox/streets-v11', <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;tileSize: 512, <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;zoomOffset: -1, <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;accessToken: 'your.mapbox.access.token' <br />
          }).addTo(mymap);</code
        >
        <p>
          Make sure all the code is called after the div and leaflet.js
          inclusion. That’s it! You have a working Leaflet map now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever using anything based on OpenStreetMap, an attribution is
          obligatory as per the copyright notice. Most other tile providers
          (such as Mapbox, Stamen or Thunderforest) require an attribution as
          well. Make sure to give credit where credit is due.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="markers,_circles_and_polygons">
        <header><h1>Markers, circles and polygons</h1></header>
        <p>
          Besides tile layers, you can easily add other things to your map,
          including markers, polylines, polygons, circles, and popups. Let’s add
          a marker:
        </p>
        <code>var marker = L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(mymap);</code>
        <p>
          Adding a circle is the same (except for specifying the radius in
          meters as a second argument), but lets you control how it looks by
          passing options as the last argument when creating the object:
        </p>
        <code
          >var circle = L.circle([51.508, -0.11], { <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;color: 'red', <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;fillColor: '#f03', <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;fillOpacity: 0.5, <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;radius: 500 <br />
          }).addTo(mymap);</code
        >
        <p>Adding a polygon is as easy:</p>
        <code
          >var polygon = L.polygon([ <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;[51.509, -0.08], <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;[51.503, -0.06], <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;[51.51, -0.047] <br />
          ]).addTo(mymap);</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="working_with_popups">
        <header><h1>Working with popups</h1></header>
        <p>
          Popups are usually used when you want to attach some information to a
          particular object on a map. Leaflet has a very handy shortcut for
          this:
        </p>
        <code
          >marker.bindPopup("&#60;b&#62;Hello world!&#60;/b&#62;&#60;br&#62;I am
          a popup.").openPopup();<br />
          circle.bindPopup("I am a circle."); <br />
          polygon.bindPopup("I am a polygon.");</code
        >
        <p>
          Try clicking on our objects. The bindPopup method attaches a popup
          with the specified HTML content to your marker so the popup appears
          when you click on the object, and the openPopup method (for markers
          only) immediately opens the attached popup.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use popups as layers (when you need something more than
          attaching a popup to an object):
        </p>
        <code
          >var popup = L.popup() <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;.setLatLng([51.5, -0.09]) <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;.setContent("I am a standalone popup.") <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;.openOn(mymap);</code
        >
        <p>
          Here we use openOn instead of addTo because it handles automatic
          closing of a previously opened popup when opening a new one which is
          good for usability.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="dealing_with_events">
        <header><h1>Dealing with events</h1></header>
        <p>
          Every time something happens in Leaflet, e.g. user clicks on a marker
          or map zoom changes, the corresponding object sends an event which you
          can subscribe to with a function. It allows you to react to user
          interaction:
        </p>
        <code
          >function onMapClick(e) { <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;alert("You clicked the map at " + e.latlng); <br />
          } <br />
          <br />
          mymap.on('click', onMapClick);</code
        >
        <p>
          Each object has its own set of events — see documentation for details.
          The first argument of the listener function is an event object — it
          contains useful information about the event that happened. For
          example, map click event object (e in the example above) has latlng
          property which is a location at which the click occurred.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s improve our example by using a popup instead of an alert:</p>
        <code
          >var popup = L.popup(); <br /><br />

          function onMapClick(e) { <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;popup <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.setLatLng(e.latlng) <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.setContent("You clicked the map at " +
          e.latlng.toString()) <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.openOn(mymap); <br />
          } <br />
          <br />

          mymap.on('click', onMapClick);</code
        >
        <p>
          Try clicking on the map and you will see the coordinates in a popup.
        </p>
